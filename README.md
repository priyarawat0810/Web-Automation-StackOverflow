# Web-Automation-StackOverflow

We all know how important StackOverflow is to developers. And as I have just started to learn web development, I had to devote many hours to find a solution for a problem. So, I have made a web automation project for which we need credentials of a StackOverflow account.
In this project, we have to type a question in the terminal, and it will search and arrange the results by the number of highest votes in StackOverflow. It will then fetch the title, question description, and answer by going to the question link from the search result whose half or more than half of the question title matches the original question and thus, help us to save time by optimizing search results.

#### Modules used: puppeteer, fs, string-similarity
