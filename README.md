# Web-Automation-StackOverflow

We all know how important StackOverflow is to developers. And as I have just started to learn web development, I had to devote many hours to find a solution for a problem. So, I have made a web automation project in which we need an account in StackOverflow.
In this project, we have to type a question in the command line after the file run command. 

The project will search the question and arrange the search results by the number of highest votes in StackOverflow.
It will fetch the title, question description, and answer by going to the question link from the search results whose half or more than half of the question title matches the original question and thus, help us to save time by optimizing search results.
